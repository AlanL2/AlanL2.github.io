            <h1> OOP </h1>
            <h4><p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. This involves making classes in Java and using
                them as templates, so that multiple of the same thing can be created. Using a class as a
                template and creating something is called an <b> Object </b>.
                 <br>
            <h4><p> So let's say if we were to make a Duck class. </p> </h4>
<pre><code>public class Duck{

}</code></pre>
            <h4><p>
                All objects have what is known as <b> Properties </b>, and in Java, these are represented
                by the variables that are in the class, known as <b> Instance Variables </b>.
                <br>
                Here, we will have a variable representing if the duck is asleep or not, which can be
                represented by a boolean variable, and an age variable, representing the duck's age.
            </p></h4>
<pre><code>public class Duck{
    private int age;
    private boolean asleep;
}</code></pre>
            <h3>Creating a Constructor</h3>
            <h4><p> To be able to create objects and differentiate objects from each other,
                    we have to use a <b> constructor </b> to pass in values.</p> </h4>
            <br>
<pre><code>public class Duck{
    private int age;
    private boolean asleep;
    public Duck(int age, boolean asleep){
        this.age = age;
        this.asleep = asleep;
    }
}</code></pre>
            <br>
            <h3> Actions/Behaviours </h3>
            <h4><p> An action or behaviour is something that your object is able to do. In
                our case, let's say that the duck will be able to quack and go to sleep, and vice versa.
                We can represent these by using void methods. The second and third method will change
                the boolean instance variable, so we call this a <b> set </b> method.
            <br>
<pre><code>public class Duck{
    private int age;
    private boolean asleep;
    public Duck(int age, boolean asleep){
        this.age = age;
        this.asleep = asleep;
    }
    public void quack(){
        System.out.println("Quack!");
    }
    public void goToSleep(){
        asleep = true;
    }
    public void wakeUp(){
        asleep = false;
    }
}</code></pre>
            <br>
            <h4><p> We can also have behaviours that check for something. These are called
            <b> get </b> methods. Thus, we will check if the duck is asleep or not, and
            this is relevant to the asleep variable.</p> </h4>
            <br>
<pre><code>public class Duck{
    private int age;
    private boolean asleep;
    public Duck(int age, boolean asleep){
        this.age = age;
        this.asleep = asleep;
    }
    public void quack(){
        System.out.println("Quack!");
    }
    public void goToSleep(){
        asleep = true;
    }
    public void wakeUp(){
        asleep = false;
    }
    public boolean getSleepStatus(){
        return asleep;
    }
}</code></pre>
            <h4><p>Now, you are able to make the object do things. In our case, we can
            give the duck an age through the constructor, make it go to sleep or wake up, and
            get the sleep status of the duck to see if it is awake or asleep. </p> </h4>
            <h4> <p> To create an object, we use the <b> new </b> keyword to create a new class, and use
                the same number of parameters as there are in the constructor. </p> </h4>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    Duck d = new Duck(10, false);
}</code></pre>
        <h3> Encapsulation </h3>
        <h4> <p> Encapsulation is the hiding of information like the variables that we used in our Duck class.
            This prevents other classes from using the variables in our class. We have already done this, by using
            the <b> private </b> keyword with our variables. However, if we were to remove that keyword, then these
            variables would no longer be encapsulated. </p> </h4>
        <h3> Inheritance </h3>
        <h4> <p> This is when another class uses the similar template of a class. The original class is called
            the <b> parent </b> class, while the class using the template is called the <b> child </b> class.
            To do this, the child class must <b> extend </b> the parent class. This allows for the child class to
            by default take all of the methods of the parent class, and it is allowed to override those methods
            as well.
            <br>
            Let's say that there is a class called Animal that is the parent class, and it has its own
            encapsulated instance variables and its own methods. We can use our Duck class to extend that class,
            which takes its methods as default.
        </p></h4>
<pre><code>public class Duck extends Animal{

}</code></pre>
        <h3> Class Casting </h3>
        <h4> <p> Class casting involves the change of one class to another, either superclass to subclass
            or vice versa. Going from a subclass to a superclass is automatic, but if you are going the
            other way around, then you must manually do it.
<pre><code>Duck d = (Duck)(new Animal()); </code></pre>
        <h3> Abstract Classes </h3>
        <h4> <p> These are classes that do not have any specific information in them.
                They only have methods, that can be overridden by subclasses. Thus, Abstract Classes
                are only used to be extended and overridden for the methods to do something specific.</p> </h4>
<pre><code>public abstract class Animal{
    public abstract boolean getSleepStatus();
    public abstract boolean goToSleep();
}
private int age;
private boolean asleep;
public Duck(int age, boolean asleep){
    this.age = age;
    this.asleep = asleep;
}
public void quack(){
    System.out.println("Quack!");
}
public void goToSleep(){ //overriding the origial abstract method
    asleep = true;
}
public void wakeUp(){
    asleep = false;
}
public boolean getSleepStatus(){ //overriding the original abstract method
    return asleep;
}
</code></pre>
